I decided to build my own product. What happened next surprised me.

## The Setup

I had a small idea sparked by something I saw online. Instead of just running with it, I tried something different. I treated ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini as my co-founders.

I told each one: "Assume your co-founders made mistakes in previous products that caused failures, but they also had brilliant ideas. Challenge them. Find the best approach." (short version of my long prompt)

Then I did something interesting - I sent each AI's response to the others, creating a three-way debate until we found the optimal solution.

## The Development

- **100% of frontend code**: AI-generated
- **100% of tests**: AI-generated
- **80% of backend**: AI-generated

And for sure, I defend some structures, some best practices, some acceptance criteria about the tests and codes before asking them to develop.

What normally takes a team of developers a year, I accomplished in 1-2 full time weeks.

Sounds amazing, right?

## Here's the plot twist

Halfway through, I realized the AIs were creating over-engineered masterpieces. Beautiful, complex, "enterprise-grade" features that nobody asked for.

Tag categories with hierarchical relationships. Complex taxonomies. Sophisticated abstractions.

Perfect code. Wrong product.

## The Wake-Up Call

I had to stop and think for myself again. Yes, AI can write incredible code. But it defaults to complexity because complexity feels "professional."

The truth? **Less is more.**

The most elegant solutions often come from removing features, not adding them.

## My Takeaways

**‚úÖ What Works:**
- AI is an incredible force multiplier for solo developers
- Cross-AI collaboration yields better ideas than any single model
- You can build enterprise-quality products in weeks, not years

**‚ö†Ô∏è What to Watch Out For:**
- BUT you must stay in the driver's seat
- AI loves over-engineering - resist the temptation
- Simple solutions often beat sophisticated ones

## The Bottom Line

AI doesn't replace thinking - it amplifies it. The developer who learns to leverage AI while maintaining product judgment will have a massive competitive advantage.

Currently in the final stages of my product. More details coming soon! üëÄ

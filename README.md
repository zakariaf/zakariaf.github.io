# Zakaria Fatahi — Personal Website & Blog &nbsp;&nbsp; ![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/zakariaf/zakariaf.github.io?color=goldenrod)&nbsp; ![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dev_Containers-Open-deepskyblue?logo=linuxcontainers)


Welcome to my personal website repository! This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) as its foundation. I forked this theme to create a custom platform where I share articles, insights, and useful resources for software engineers.

## About This Site

I created this site to:
- **Share Knowledge:** Publish articles and tutorials covering various topics useful for software engineers—from coding best practices to project management and leadership.
- **Encourage Collaboration:** Since the site is hosted on GitHub and powered by GitHub Pages, anyone can easily access, edit, or even contribute new content via pull requests.
- **Be Open & Accessible:** All posts are publicly available so that every engineer can benefit from shared knowledge.
- **Future Expansion:** I plan to use this theme to build a Persian version of the site in the future, making the content accessible to a wider audience.

## Features

- **Blog:** Regular posts on topics ranging from technical deep-dives to practical engineering tips.
- **Open Contributions:** If you have something useful to share, feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request with your article.
- **Customizable:** Built on the flexible Chirpy theme, you can easily tweak the design and settings to suit your preferences.
- **GitHub & GitHub Pages:** Leveraging GitHub Pages ensures that the content is always available and easy to maintain, with version control at its core.

## Getting Started

To run a local copy of the site for development:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zakariaf/zakariaf.github.io.git
   cd zakariaf.github.io
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Ensure you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) installed, then run:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Serve the site locally:**

   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

   Open your browser at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view the site.

## Customization

Since this repository is a fork of the Chirpy theme, I've customized it to match my personal branding and needs. You can modify:

- **_config.yml:** Change site settings, metadata, and plugins.
- **Assets and Styles:** Update CSS and JavaScript for visual tweaks.
- **Content:** Edit posts in the `_posts` directory, update the About page, and add new articles.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to help make this blog a rich resource for the software engineering community. If you have an idea for an article or want to add useful content, simply fork the repository and submit a pull request. All contributions, from small tweaks to full articles, are appreciated!

## Future Plans

- **Persian Version:** I plan to create a Persian version of this website using the same theme, making the content accessible to Persian-speaking developers.
- **Expanded Topics:** Continue to explore new topics, tools, and best practices in software development and leadership.
